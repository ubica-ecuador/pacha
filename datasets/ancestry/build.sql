-- Ancestry of every U.S. census tract, after the New York Times ancestry map of
-- July 2026, as the Parquet files the ancestry-census dashboard reads through
-- the gateway (http://feeds/datasets/ancestry/...), and the spatial weights
-- the ancestry-esda dashboard adds to them. Run by build.sh, which sets
-- `src` (the folder of downloaded Census files) and `year`, and runs this in
-- the folder the files are written to.
--
-- The NYT does not publish its derived dataset but names its source, the
-- American Community Survey. api.census.gov rejects keyless requests, so this
-- reads the table-based summary files off www2.census.gov instead.
--
-- A note on the data, repeated in the dashboard because it changes how the map
-- reads: ACS ancestry is a multiple-response, self-reported question, and not
-- the same universe as Hispanic origin or detailed race. Three tables are
-- stacked to reach the ~200 groups the NYT shows:
--   B04006 People Reporting Ancestry               -> source 'ancestry'
--   B03001 Hispanic or Latino Origin by Specific   -> source 'hispanic_origin'
--   B02015 Asian Alone by Selected Groups          -> source 'asian_group'
-- and per-tract totals are renormalised where they overlap.
--
-- Deterministic: the 1.35 million dots are scattered with hash(geoid, i), not
-- a random generator, and every output has a total ORDER BY.
